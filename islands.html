    <h2>Pacific Island Highlights</h2>

    <p>
        The Pacific is made up of many islands, each with a different look and feeling. This page gives
        a short overview of four islands that show how different the region can be, even though they all
        share the same ocean.

            <h3>Hawaiʻi</h3>
            <p>
                Hawaiʻi mixes tall city buildings with steep cliffs and valleys. Visitors can hike,
                surf, or just sit by the water. It is also a place where many Pacific Islanders study
                and work, so it feels familiar and new at the same time.

            <h3>Fiji</h3>
            <p>
                Fiji has bright blue water and coral below the surface. A lot of life here happens in
                small villages and resorts near the beach. The ocean is the main road that connects
                people and places.

            <h3>Samoa</h3>
            <p>
                Samoa is full of green landscapes, lava cliffs, and beaches that feel peaceful. Stories,
                language, and village life are still strong, and visitors can see how important respect
                and community are.

            <p>
                Tonga is made up of many islands spread across the ocean. It is known for royal history
                and a deep connection to the sea. From whale watching to family gatherings, Tonga shows
                how culture and land are tied together.
