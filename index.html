        <h2>Explore the Islands of the Pacific</h2>
        <p>
            This site is a simple guide to some of my favorite islands in the Pacific. It is not a full
            travel site, but more like a personal project that shares places I think are beautiful and
            worth learning about.

            <h3>Hawaiʻi</h3>
            <p>
                Hawaiʻi is known for surfing, warm beaches, and a mix of modern city life and island
                traditions. It is one of the easiest Pacific islands to visit and a popular first stop.

            <h3>Fiji</h3>
            <p>
                Fiji has clear water, coral reefs, and small islands that feel calm and quiet. It is a
                good place for snorkeling and slower, relaxed trips.

            <h3>Tonga</h3>
            <p>
                Tonga is called the Friendly Islands and is known for strong culture, family, and
                connections to the ocean. It is less busy than many tourist spots.
