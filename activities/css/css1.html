        <p><li>Inline CSS is written in the element and only styles that one thing. Embedded CSS is written in a style tag and styles just that page. External CSS is written in a separate file and can style many pages. External CSS is best because it keeps code clean and easy to update. A selector tells CSS which element to style.</li></p>
        <p><li>You should use external CSS because it keeps your code clean, makes it easier to manage, and lets you update many pages at once.</li></p>
        <p><li>A selector is used to tell CSS which element you want to style.</li></p>
