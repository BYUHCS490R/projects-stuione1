    <h1>Engagement - Git and GitHub Help</h1>
    <p>1. You can get help by emailing the instructor for office hours, checking Canvas/lecture notes, or seeing the tutors at night.</p>
    <p>2. Engagement assignments are due on Canvas by the listed date, cannot be turned in late, and if you miss one you get a 0 unless excused for rare circumstances.</p>
    <p>3. Projects are due on their scheduled dates, normally cannot be late, but you may use one of your four resubmissions to submit up to a week late or to fix a missed project.</p>
    <p>4. Today we discussed basic HTML tags such as html, head, body, headings, paragraphs, links, and images, which are reviewed in the lecture video.</p>
    <p>5. Paste your webpage link here, or if it doesnâ€™t work, paste your questions and then see the tutors tonight for help.</p>
