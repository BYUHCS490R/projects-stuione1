    <h2>Island Foods</h2>

    <p>
        Food is one of the easiest ways to feel at home on an island. Many dishes are simple but
        filling, using ingredients that come from the ocean, the land, or backyard gardens. The table
        below lists a few common foods you might see across different Pacific islands.

        These dishes are just a small taste of what each island offers. Every family has its own
        favorite version of these foods, and recipes are often passed down by watching and helping in
        the kitchen instead of reading from a book.
