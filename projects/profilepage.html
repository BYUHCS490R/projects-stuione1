    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a college student who is learning the basics of web design and <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>. I like simple pages that load fast and make sense. I try to write clear code, test a little each day, and stay consistent &mdash; even when it is slow.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I enjoy sports, family time, and building small projects for class. I play <strong>pickleball</strong> and surf when the weather is good. I also lift to keep my legs strong on Saturdays, which helps recovery on Sunday &amp; keeps me moving.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>This semester I want to practice clean HTML5 and keep improving my writing. I am focusing on readable code, basic accessibility, and steady progress. I also want to share work that feels honest and simple, not fancy.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Focus (A–D)</h2>
    <ol type="A">
        <li><mark>Classwork</mark>: finish assignments on time.</li>
        <li>Practice: review notes and small <em>code</em> snippets.</li>
        <li>Training: lower‑body work on Saturday.</li>
        <li>Community: check in with friends and mentors.</li>
    </ol>
