        <h1>My Hero - Sione Tui'one</h1>
        <p>My Father, Sione Tui'one has always been my hero. He grew up dirt poor in the Island of Tonga and had to learn first hand that working hard and dillegence was key to building a life you want. He is the most powerful man I know and was the best Father one could want. Although he was firm and taught with tough love, he lead with God at the helm and always told us to put him first in everything we do.</p>
        <DL><strong>Interesting facts about my Dad:</strong>
            <dt>Unschooled</dt>
                <dd>Never had a formal education. In the worlds eyes he may not be the smartest man, but in mine, he is the wisest person I know</dd>
            
            <dt>Church Oriented</dt>
                <dd>He was baptized at 18 years old. Because of his lack of a formal education, the Church is all he has known. The biggest spiritual giant I know. He is currently serving as an Area Seventy in the Pacific and also is employed by the Church to oversea the infrastructure and building maintanence in the Pacific</dd>
            
            <dt>Goofy</dt>
                <dd>Because of some of the callings and titles hes held over the years, a lot of people have always known him to be very concecrated and serious at times, but he is actually very very goofy and those who are close to him know that</dd>
