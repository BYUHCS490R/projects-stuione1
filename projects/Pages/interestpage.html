        <h1>My Interests - Sports</h1>
        <h2>Rugby</h2>
        <p>I grew up in New Zealand, where Rugby is our national sport. There are pletny forms of Rugby. We have Rugby Union which is what I grew up playing. Rugby League which is my <span class="special">favorite style</span> and we can even play Touch Rugby which is probably the most fun</p>
        <h2>Pickleball</h2>
        <p class="highlight">I just got into Pickleball about a year ago. This is probably my persona right now aswell as my family. We play every week. Its such a fun style of play that envolves not only playing with intensity but also being smart with shots</p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>An <b>absolute link</b> is a full website link (URL) that includes details of how to find the link. A <b>relative link</b> is link that shows the path relative to the current folder or page</p>
        <p><b>Absolute Link</b> example <a href="https://youtu.be/vYSP5nhhzQg?si=ESEAHhexNDluQjtC">here</a></p>
        <p class="deemphasize"><b>Relative Link</b> example <a href="profilepage.html">here</a></p>
        <h2>Color Choices (Q&A)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What color did you choose to emphasize text? <span class="highlight">Green</span></li>
            <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? <span class="deemphasize">Gray</span></li>
            <li>How did you choose your colors? I picked colors that looked simple and readable with my background. <span class="special">Red</span> is used for extra attention.</li>
